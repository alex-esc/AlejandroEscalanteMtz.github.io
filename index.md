## Hey! I'm alex-esc, a young music producer and music programmer from Mexico. I develop electronic musical instruments on my free time, work with a few local bands, play the piano and sing and really like my coffee in high doses.

## I'm really into movies, technology and the web, digital arts, psychology, writing and blogging, some philosophy here and there, all types of music and getting into a good book every once in a while.

## I'm happy to help you out with music production, making you or your band a custom instrument or writing custom software for your live setup.
