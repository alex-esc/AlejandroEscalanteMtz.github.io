## Hey! I'm alex-esc, I program and create digital musical instruments, help a few local artists with music production and recording, make electronic music of my own, play the piano and sing for a bit, blog every once in a while, make my own tools, do some computers stuff, joke around a lot, and really like my coffee in high doses.

## I'm really into movies, technology and the web, digital arts, psychology, some philosophy here and there, all types of music and getting into a good book every once in a while.

## I am happy to help people out on music production, instrument development, technology education and just having a good time talking about techy stuff or just hanging out. If you'd like to give me a call, check out the *contact me* section.
